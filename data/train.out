Step 1: Buy a can of black spray paint Step 2: Stir up each ant mound with a stick. The ants will emerge by the hundreds to defend their mound.  Step 3: Spray each mound and the surrounding area, make sure you get plenty of paint on the ants as well.  Once the ants realize they live in a black neighborhood, they  quit working and start killing each other.  Problem solved.
